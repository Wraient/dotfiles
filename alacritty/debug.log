The former deeming Sasuke a possible replacement for Nagato's role in their plan once under their full control, Tobi and Black Zetsu discuss Nagato's unexpected betrayal and that Naruto's actions have now forced their hand to prematurely hasten their plan. Meanwhile, as Danzo makes preparations for the summit while assigning one of his followers to eliminate Kabuto and acquire his human experiment research, Karui interrogates Naruto about everything he knows on Sasuke. But Naruto refuses to sell Sasuke out and instead tells Karui to take her anger out on him instead, with Sai and Omoi eventually intervening before Samui arrives to pick up her wards to meet up with the Raikage with the intel they got. Later, while having Sai tend to his injuries so not to make Sakura worry, Naruto tells Kakashi Hatake and Yamato that he intends to convince the Raikage to forgive Sasuke. When the two refuse to allow it, Naruto reveals his encounter with the chakra imprint of Minato. He tells them what the Fourth Hokage told him about the Nine Tails incident caused by Tobi which Kakashi speculates to be possibly the First Hokage's nemesis Madara Uchiha. When Naruto also revealed that Minato professed his belief in him, Kakashi changes his mind as he and a reluctant Yamato agree to escort Naruto to the Five Kage Summit.
